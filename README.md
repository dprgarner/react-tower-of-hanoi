# react-tower-of-hanoi

An implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, with pure react.

------
To start the Webpack auto-refreshing dev server:
```
./start [--open] <port>
```
To start the dev server and also open the browser at the current URL, add the
`--open` option.

The auto-refreshing webpack server can sometimes miss file change events when
using vim. To fix this, change the vim setting `:set backupcopy=yes`.
